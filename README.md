# üß† Personalized Portfolio Management System (PMS)

This project aims to build a real-world, intelligent, and customizable portfolio management system that uses investor profiling, asset class modeling, rule-based screening, Monte Carlo simulations, and deep learning‚Äìbased personalization to generate optimal portfolios.

---

## üîß Project Objective

To design a pipeline that:

- Collects detailed investor profiles
- Converts those preferences into quantitative investment boundaries
- Allocates capital across asset classes (equity, debt, gold, etc.)
- Filters relevant securities from a large market universe
- Applies Monte Carlo simulation to generate optimal portfolios
- Provides real-world-ready, executable portfolios based on portfolio size
- (Optionally) Uses deep learning for highly personalized security selection

## üìå Core Pipeline Options

We have designed two flows:

---

### ‚úÖ **Pipeline A: Rule-Based Flow (MVP)**

1. **Investor Profile Collection**
   - Risk tolerance, return objectives, liquidity needs, etc.

2. **Model 2: Asset Class Weight Prediction**
   - Outputs e.g., Equity 50%, Debt 30%, Gold 20%

3. **Rule-Based Filtering of Securities**
   - Based on returns, volatility, liquidity, etc.
   - Selects ~30‚Äì50 securities per asset class

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
   - Simulates 1000s of portfolios to find optimal allocation

5. **Post-Processing**
   - Prunes securities with tiny weights (based on minimum allocation threshold)
   - Re-runs simulation on pruned set if needed

---

### üöÄ **Pipeline B: Enhanced Flow with Deep Learning Personalization**

Same as above **plus an extra model for deeper personalization**.

4. **Model 4: Deep Learning-Based Security Ranking**
   - Ranks securities per investor using their profile, behavior, sector biases, and past data
   - Selects top 15‚Äì20 securities per class *before* simulation

5. **Monte Carlo Simulation on Personalized Universe**
   - Simulation on the tailored shortlist

6. **Final Pruning and Re-Evaluation**
   - Ensures executable and clean portfolio, especially for smaller investment sizes

## üí° Key Concepts Integrated

- **Monte Carlo Simulation** for portfolio optimization  
- **CVaR, VaR, Sharpe Ratio** as portfolio quality measures  
- **Modular design**: Each step is separable and pluggable  
- **Real-world practicality**:
  - Limits on number of securities based on investment size
  - Constraints like minimum ‚Çπ allocation per security
- **Personalization**:
  - Behavioral & preference-aware deep learning ranking model (Model 4)

---

## üîç Why This Project?

Most advisory systems provide generic outputs. This project attempts to go beyond:
- Adding personalization at both **asset class** and **security** levels
- Adapting portfolios based on **investor psychology, behavior, and constraints**
- Ensuring output is **realistically investible**, not just mathematically optimal
