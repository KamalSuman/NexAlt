Portfolio Management System (PMS) – Simple Overview
Main Concept

We aim to build a model that uses an individual’s Risk Capacity and Risk Tolerance to create and manage their investment portfolio.
This model takes around 10–12 inputs to calculate important financial metrics like:

CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)
VaR (Value at Risk)
Risk Budgeting
Expected Returns
Using Monte Carlo Simulation, we can generate a range of possible portfolio outcomes to help make better decisions.

1. Planning Step
This is the starting point where we gather important information such as:

Risk tolerance (via a psychological questionnaire)
Return expectations
Investment time horizon
Tax details
Liquidity needs (how easily they want to access their money)
Income needs
Unique personal circumstances
All this information helps us create an Investment Policy Statement (IPS) — a formal document that defines the investor’s goals and acts as a roadmap for investing.

IPS should be updated regularly
For retail investors, needs change more frequently. So, we plan to use NLP (Natural Language Processing) to read financial messages (like emails or reports) and automatically detect any changes in their situation to keep the IPS up to date.
2. Execution Step
Once the IPS is ready:

We analyze risk and return for different asset classes (like equity, debt, gold, etc.)
Based on macroeconomic data, we choose which asset classes are more promising.
Within each class, we select the most attractive securities.
If we manage a discretionary account, we can also include:
Alternative Investments: Hedge Funds, Commodities, Private Capital
(These can follow a profit-sharing model)
For non-discretionary accounts, we only give investment recommendations for regular asset classes.
We’ll use:

Monte Carlo Simulation
Sharpe Ratio
CVaR
Minimum Variance Portfolio
to analyze and build the best possible investment plan.
3. Feedback & Monitoring Step
Investments are not “set-and-forget.” We will:

Continuously monitor changes in the risk-return profile of the asset classes
Adjust the portfolio weights automatically to reflect new realities
This keeps the portfolio optimized and aligned with the client’s updated financial situation and market conditions.
